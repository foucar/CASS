/**
@section using Using CASS
CASS is capable of running online and get the data from the LCLS datastream and
offline when it gets the data from the xtc files written by the LCLS DAQ.
Depending on the settings during compiletime one can compile CASS for either
online or offline mode. Please see @ref compiling for details.\n
A complete list of all parameters can be found here @ref clpar. Some of the
parameters are only working with the online version some of them only with the
offline version of CASS.


@subsection online Online
Running cass online envolves that you use the shared memory acess to the data
provided by LCLS. This access is only available on selected dedicated computers.
For the AMO-Hutch this is "daq-amo-mon01" ... "daq-amo-mon04". Please ask the
LCLS DAQ person on which machine you will have access to the the online data
stream.\n
When starting the online CASS program you need to tell it where to find the
shared memory that has been preset by the DAQ people. (One can list the files
in /dev/shm to see which shared memroy tags have been set up). The shared
memory tag will told to the program with the
- p partition tag for accessing the shared memory
parameter. If more than one person is running on the same machine trying to get
the data from the online stream it is possible to assing an id to each one with
the
- c client id for shared memory access
parameter.
With the
- s TCP port of the soap server
parameter you tell the program on which port the cass histograms are provided to
the viewers. See @ref viewers for details on how to use this parameter in the
viewer.
The
- f optional complete path to the cass.ini to use
parameter lets you choose which .ini file to use. Please see @ref inifilesetup
for details of the contents of the .ini file. If this paramter is not set CASS
will defaultly load CASS.ini that resides in the UserScope path. On Unix or Mac
OS X this is $HOME/.config or $HOME/Settings.ÃŸn
A typical program start command looks like this:\
"./cass -p 0_1_cass_AMO -c 0 -f "inifilename""\n
For your convenience the most recent cass binary is located in\n
"/reg/g/cass/bin/"\n
In this location you will also find the convenience startup scripts. The one that
loads cass with the paramters described in the example above is called
"/reg/g/cass/bin/startCASS.sh"



@subsection offline Offline
The offline version of CASS will process the xtc file that were recorded by the
LCLS DAQ. Please put all files that you want to process into a txt file. Then
provide the name of the text file to CASS with the
- i filename containing filesnames of xtcfiles to process
parameter.\n
Usually CASS will not quit after it has finishes processing all the files. It
will keep all histograms in memory to be accessable via the viewers. If you would
like CASS to quit after it has processed all provided files you have to pass the
- q quit after finished with all files
paramter to CASS at the program start.\n
Sometimes you don't want to have all the rate output, ie. when you run
the program in a batched way on a cluster. You can suppress the output with the
- r suppress the rate output
parameter.



@subsection viewer The Viewers
To look at the histograms that are created and filled by CASS one has two
options.@ref jocassview and @ref lucassview. Both viewers need to be told on
which server CASS is running and on which port it will listen for requests.



@subsubsection jocassview Jocassview
This viewer is based on QWT. A library for scientific widgets that are based on
QT. To start this viewer on the SLAC computers one has to tell where to find
the QWT library by first putting it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. IE.\n

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/reg/g/cass/lib
./jocassview



@subsubsection lucassview Lucassview
This viewer is based on ROOT which was developed by CERN people and is a C++
library for all kinds of things. To start this viewer on the SLAC computers one
has to set PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the binary and the library path
of the root installation. IE.\n

export ROOTSYS=/reg/common/package/root/5.24.00-x86_64-nodebug\n
export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH\n
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n
./lucassview\n
