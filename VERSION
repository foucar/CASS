This is the layout of the version Number

1.2.3
^ ^ ^
| | |
| | +--- Build number
| +----- Minor version number
+------- Major version number

Try to use the RubyGems Rational Versioning policy in which:

    The Major version number is incremented when binary compatibility is broken
    The Minor version number is incremented when new functionality is added
    The Build number changes for bug fixes /typos

When releasing a version (pushing a commit in the master branch to the repository)
you need to give a tag according to the version number described above first.
