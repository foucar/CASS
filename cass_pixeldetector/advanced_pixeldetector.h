/** An Advanced Pixel Detector
 *
 * This class describes a pixel detector which has all the opertors to analyse
 * and extract the additional information internally.
 *
 * @cassttng PixelDetectors/\%name\%/{Detector}\n
 *           The detector that contains the ccd image. Default is 0. Options are:
 *           - 0: Front pnCCD
 *           - 1: Rear pnCCD
 *           - 2: 1st commercial CCD in AMO
 *           - 3: 2nd commercial CCD in AMO
 *           - 4: 3rd commercial CCD in AMO
 *           - 6: 4th commercial CCD in AMO
 *           - 5: 1st commercial CCD in XPP
 *           - 7: Front CsPad in CXI
 *           - 8: Rear CsPad in CXI
 * @cassttng PixelDetectors/\%name\%/{FrameProcessorType}\n
 *           Functor for processing the frame. Default is "none". Options are:
 *           - "none": No processing is done to the frame, just the raw frame
 *                     will be returned
 *           - "hll": The type of processing that the semiconductor lab applies
 *                    to their frame data. see cass::pixeldetector::HLLProcessor
 * @cassttng PixelDetectors/\%name\%/{PixelFinderType}\n
 *           Functor for finding pixels of interest in the frame. The pixels
 *           will be found after the frame processor has processed the frame.
 *           Default is "aboveNoise". Options are:
 *           - "aboveNoise": uses the noise map
 *                           (see cass::pixeldetector::CommonData) to check
 *                           whether a pixel is of interest. See
 *                           cass::pixeldetector::AboveNoiseFinder
 *           - "simple": checks whether a pixel value is higher than the
 *                       pixelvalues of the neighbours.
 *                       See cass::pixeldetector::PixelFinderSimple
 *           - "simpleMoreOptions": checks whether a pixel value is higher than the
 *                       pixelvalues of the neighbours defining a box
 *                       See cass::pixeldetector::PixelFinderSimpleMoreOptions
 *           - "range": checks whether the pixel value is a user set range. See
 *                      cass::pixeldetector::WithinRange
 * @cassttng PixelDetectors/\%name\%/{CoalescingFunctionType}\n
 *           Functor to coalesce the pixels into hits. Default is "simple".
 *           Options are:
 *           - "simple": simple coalescing with basic checks.
 *                       See cass::pixeldetector::SimpleCoalesce.
 * @cassttng there are more settings for the common data. Please see
 *           cass::pixeldetector::CommonData for details on what to set.
