 *
 * @section download Getting CASS
 * You can access cass via svn from the following Repository:\n
 * https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/repos/lutz/diode \n
 * The version we are working with right now is to be found in\n
 * /trunk\n
 * an "anonymous" readonly access for checking out can be done using\n
 * username: asg\n
 * password: cass\n
 * (please contact Lutz Foucar for write access)
 *
 * @section desc Brief description about program flow
 * There are two types of threads running. They are both accessing a shared entity
 * the ringbuffer. The producer thread is the shared memory input. The are several
 * worker threads that will work on the created cassevents. Here is a short
 * describtion of what the two thread types will do:
 * -# Shared Memory Thread (single thread)
 *   -# get lcls data
 *   -# takes out a cassevent from ringbuffer
 *   -# converter converts lcls -> cassevent
 *   -# puts it back to ringbuffer
 * -# Worker Thread (optional multiple threads)
 *   -# takes cassevent out of ringbuffer
 *   -# puts it to
 *    -# analyzer
 *      -# puts it to the preanalyzers of different devices
 *    -# postanalyzers
 *      -# list of userdefined analyzers that extract info from cassevent and
 *         put results it in histograms.
 *   -# puts worked on cassevent back to ringbuffer to be filled again
 *
 * - Program control is done via a tcpip interface
 * - Accesss histograms created by postprocessors via tcpip interface
 * - Parameters are loaded using qt's qsettings. @see @ref run
 *
 * @section inst Installing CASS
 * See the @ref cassinstall file as the primary installation documentation.
 *
 * @section run Running CASS
 * In Order to run the cass you need to start it with a parameter, the partition
 * tag. When running at LCLS in the daq state you need to provide the partition
 * tag of the shared memory server you want to connect to. \n
 * User settable parameters are to be found in "CASS.ini". The latter can be found
 * in the user scope path. From the QSettings documentary: "The default UserScope
 * paths on Unix and Mac OS X ($HOME/.config or $HOME/Settings) can be overridden
 * by the user by setting the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable."
 * @see http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qsettings.html#setPath
 *
 * @subsection testing Testing CASS in offline mode (DAQ simulation)
 * For testing CASS you can create the shared memory using xtcmonserver located
 * in the build directory of the LCLS subfolder. This will take a xtc file and
 * put the contents into the shared memory. You have to give it serval commands
 * which are documented when you run it without any command. A typical start
 * command will look like this:\n
 *
 * LCLS/build/pdsdata/bin/x86_64-linux/xtcmonserver -f xtcfile.xtc -n 4
 * -s 0x1000000 -p test -r 120 -l\n
 * - f: filename of file that you want to create the shared memory with
 * - n: number of datagrams to be stored in the buffer
 * - s: size of the buffer for that stores one datagram
 * - p: the name of the partition tag
 * - r: the rate that you want to simulate
 * - l: loop. If the end of the file has been reached start from the beginning
 * - v: verbose output. Includes the spare time, which can be used to
 *         calculate the time in ns it took to read the event from file and put
 *         it into the shared memory (buisy time).\n
 *         sparetime = 1e9 / rate - buisy time.
 *
 * @subsection Running CASS with file input ("offlinecass")
 * If CASS has been compiled in offline mode (see the @ref cassinstall file),
 * then it will read data from XTC files on the filesystem rather than from
 * shared memory.  First, create a file called "filesToProcess.txt" in the
 * working directory containing the names of the XTC files to use.  Then
 * simply run CASS as normal, without the "-p" option.  All postprocessors
 * and options can be used as normal, and you can additionally enable
 * postprocessor #1001 for HDF5 file output.
 *
 * Running CASS in this offline mode is similar to using "xtcmonserver", but
 * there is one important difference:  The event buffer will be made to block
 * if events cannot be processed quickly enough, instead of skipping events.
 *
 * If you get weird HDF5 error messages when using pp1001, make sure your
 * HDF5 library was compiled with thread safety enabled.

 * @see @ref authors file in distribution for details
 *
 * @date 2009-2010
 *
 * @todo only retrieve the last ccd / waveform when requested
 * @todo describe how to use Nicolas ROI.
 * @todo create another acqiris detector, that will just measure the voltage
 *       on a given channel
 * @todo make detector evaluation lazy by having the getters calc all values.
 * @todo right now we cannot define a postprocessors dependency on the
 *       converter that it needs. We need to include this dependency.
 *       Maybe using cass.ini?
 * @todo create pp: cummulative average commercial ccd image with condition on
 *       tof and pos on delayline detector
 * @todo move main documentation to own file.
 * @todo next to the cass executable create a cass library so that the viewer
 *       can use the histogram part for it.
 * @todo find out how one can use xrefitem so that it will list consecutive
 *       items under one title, just like todo does.
 * @todo create pp that will convert all active pp histograms to root histo and
 *       store it in .root file.
 * @todo add possibilty in cassview to write 2d histograms as csv file
 * @todo add gui's to modify the postprocessors settings in cassviewer.
 * @todo make postprocessors is's to have pair<size_t,size_t> to be able to
 *       have userdefined number of instances of on pp
 * @todo create pp for beam energy
 * @todo create boolean AND and boolean OR 0d pp
 * @todo create boolean AND and boolean OR 0d pp
 * @todo create comparison 0d pp less than constant
 * @todo create comparison 0d pp greater than constant
 * @todo create comparison 0d pp equal to constant
 * @todo create pp that will histogram a 0d pp value
 * @todo create pp that will create an running average of a histogram
 * @todo create boolean xor 0d pp
 * @todo make a file with all convenience helpers
