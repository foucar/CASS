 * @section download Getting CASS
 * You can access cass via svn from the following Repository:\n
 * https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/repos/lutz/diode \n
 * The version we are working with right now is to be found in\n
 * /branches/lutz\n
 * an "anonymous" readonly access for checking out can be done using\n
 * username: asg\n
 * password: cass\n
 * (please contact Lutz Foucar for write access)
 *
 * @section desc Brief description about program flow
 * There are two types of threads running. They are both accessing a shared entity
 * the ringbuffer. The producer thread is the shared memory input. The are several
 * worker threads that will work on the created cassevents. Here is a short
 * describtion of what the two thread types will do:
 * -# Shared Memory Thread (single thread)
 *   -# get lcls data
 *   -# takes out a cassevent from ringbuffer
 *   -# converter converts lcls -> cassevent
 *   -# puts it back to ringbuffer
 * -# Worker Thread (optional multiple threads)
 *   -# takes cassevent out of ringbuffer
 *   -# puts it to
 *    -# analyzer
 *      -# puts it to the preanalyzers of different devices
 *    -# postanalyzers
 *      -# list of userdefined analyzers that extract info from cassevent and
 *         put results it in histograms.
 *   -# puts worked on cassevent back to ringbuffer to be filled again
 *
 * - Program control is done via a tcpip interface
 * - Accesss histograms created by postprocessors via tcpip interface
 * - Parameters are loaded using qt's qsettings. @see @ref run
 *
 * @section inst Installing CASS
 * See the @ref cassinstall file as the primary installation documentation.
 * @subsection pre Prerequisites
 * The following software packages need to be installed and available for
 * building and running CASS:\n
 * - Qt version 4.5.x or 4.6.x
 * @subsection env Needed Environment Variables
 * - LCLSSYSINCLUDE: needs to point to the root folder of LCLS Stuff that
 *   contains the pdsdata folder\n
 * - LCLSSYSLIB: needs to point to the folder the build libraries are in.\n
 * - QTDIR:   needs to point where Qt is installed\n
 * @subsection build Building CASS
 * @subsubsection build_LCLS Compile the LCLS libraries
 * cd ${CASS top-level directory}/LCLS \n
 * make x86_64-linux
 * @subsubsection build_CASS Compile CASS
 * Go back to the CASS top-level directory and use qmake with appropriate
 * options to create Makefiles, i. e.,
 * - cd ${CASS top-level directory}
 * - qmake -r
 * then run
 * - make
 * - (optional)sudo make install
 * to build and install the software.
 *
 * @section run Running CASS
 * In Order to run the cass you need to start it with a parameter, the partition
 * tag. When running at LCLS in the daq state you need to provide the partition
 * tag of the shared memory server you want to connect to. \n
 * User settable parameters are to be found in "CASS.ini". The latter can be found
 * in the user scope path. From the QSettings documentary: "The default UserScope
 * paths on Unix and Mac OS X ($HOME/.config or $HOME/Settings) can be overridden
 * by the user by setting the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable."
 * @see http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qsettings.html#setPath
 * @subsection testing Testing CASS in offline modus
 * For testing CASS you can create the shared memory using xtcmonserver located
 * in the build directory of the LCLS subfolder. This will take a xtc file and
 * put the contents into the shared memory. You have to give it serval commands
 * which are documented when you run it without any command. A typical start
 * command will look like this:\n
 *
 * LCLS/build/pdsdata/bin/x86_64-linux/xtcmonserver -f xtcfile.xtc -n 4
 * -s 0x1000000 -p test -r 120 -l\n
 * <ul>
 *  <li>f: filename of file that you want to create the shared memory with
 *  <li>n: number of datagrams to be stored in the buffer
 *  <li>s: size of the buffer for that stores one datagram
 *  <li>p: the name of the partition tag
 *  <li>r: the rate that you want to simulate
 *  <li>l: loop. If the end of the file has been reached start from the beginning
 *  <li>v: verbose output. Includes the spare time, which can be used to
 *         calculate the time in ns it took to read the event from file and put
 *         it into the shared memory (buisy time).\n
 *         sparetime = 1e9 / rate - buisy time.
