    /**
     *  User settable parameters via CASS.ini
     *  each of the following is defined for each pnCCD detector and
     *  may be defined in a different way on different pnCCD detectors
     *  @cassttng
     *  RebinFactor\n
     *        The rebinfactor for rebinning of the frame accectable values are 1,2,4 and any power of 2.\n
     *        By default the value is set to 1.
     *  @cassttng
     *  MaxNoise\n
     *        The max allowed noise level before a pixel is mask off, the limit is interpreted as
     *        std dev, if the pixel displays a noise level largen than _max_noise than it is removed.\n
     *        By default the value is set to 4000.
     *  @cassttng
     *  SigmaMultiplier\n
     *        The number of std deviation a pixel must be above noise to be selected as a photon.\n
     *        By default the value is set to 4.\n
     *  @cassttng
     *  Adu2ev\n
     *        The adu to eV conversion constant.\n
     *        By default the value is set to 1.\n
     *  @cassttng
     *  CreatePixelList\n
     *        True or false, if true and if _doOffsetCorrection==true
     *            (irregardless of the value of _useCommonMode) a list of Photons will be created
     *            for each pixel with value larger that _sigmaMultiplier*noise(of the pixel).\n
     *        By default the value is set to false.\n
     *  @cassttng
     *  DoOffsetCorrection\n
     *        True or false, if true the darkcalibration maps will be used to subtract the ADC
     *            offset, to correct the raw frame.\n
     *        By default the value is set to false.\n
     *  @cassttng
     *  useCommonMode\n
     *       True or false, useful only if _doOffsetCorrection==true,\n
     *            if true the CommonMode correction will be calculated and applied to the pixels
     *            each "row" of 128-pixel is separately considered: the pixels that have
     *            value below _sigmaMultiplier*noise(of the pixel), once their offset is removed,
     *            and that are not marked as BAD are used, the arithmetical mean is calculated and
     *            subtracted from all the pixels.\n
     *        By default the value is set to false.
     *  @cassttng
     *  useCTECorr\n
     *       True or false,\n
     *            use 'useCTECorrection' as key in ini-file\n
     *            if true the Charge Correction Efficiency correction will be applied to the pixels.\n
     *        By default the value is set to false.
     *  @cassttng
     *  useGAINCorr\n
     *       True or false,\n
     *            use 'useGAINCorrection' as key in ini-file\n
     *            if true the Gain correction will be applied to the pixels.\n
     *        By default the value is set to false.
     *  @cassttng
     *  UseDarkcalBadPixelInfo\n
     *       True or false, by default UseDarkcalBadPixelInfo==false,\n
     *            useful only if IsDarkFrames==false,\n
     *            if true the pixel(s) that have a noise larger than MaxNoise are masked, regardless
     *            of the fact that the offset correction and/or the common mode correction are
     *            performed;\n
     *            if false, no extra pixel will be masked on base of its noise level!
     *  @cassttng
     *  autoSaveDarkCals\n
     *       True or false, by default autoSaveDarkCals==false,
     *            useful only if IsDarkFrames==true.\n
     *            If true when exactly 200 frames (per detector) have been collected, the Darkcal 
     *            filemap(s) is(are) saved and the value of _isDarkframe is set to false.\n
     *            The program is NOT able to reload the setting-file as the file itself has not been changed.\n
     *            The user should reload the cass-settings, or restart cass, only after he/she is sure that
     *            the cassini file has been modified in the proper way!\n
     *            If false the program will continue indefinetly to add frames to the darkcal arrays,
     *            and the user needs to give from jocassview (or any client application that would perform
     *            similar tasks) the "Write Darkcal File" command to save the calibrations into file(s).
     *  @cassttng
     *  IntegralOverThres (internally called _thres_for_integral )\n
     *       Any Integer>=0 is accepted, in case the value is >0 than a second integral over the
     *            corrected frame is calculated, this time using only those pixel that have a
     *            value>_thres_for_integral.\n
     *        By default the value is set to 0.\n
     *  @cassttng
     *  DarkCalibrationFileName\n
     *       If set the darkframe calibrations will be taken out of the named file.\n
     *       PLEASE DO NOT SET unless you know what you are using,
     *       (for example if using offline CASS)
     *       darkframe files created via Xonline/Raccoon will be ignored as they have
     *       a completely different structure.
     *  @cassttng
     *  DarkCalibrationSaveFileName\n
     *       It contains the name of the files where darkframe calibrations will be written into
     *       the values are ANYWAY overwritten by the saveParameter function to avoid
     *       overwriting of previously saved darkframe files.
     *  @cassttng
     *  GAINCalibrationFileName\n
     *       It contains the name of the files where GAIN calibrations will be taken out.\n
     *  @cassttng
     *  useHLLFormatGainCTEReader\n
     *       Use Mirkos Parser for the CTE Gain File from HLL. Default is false
     *       which case Nicolas Parser will be used.\n
