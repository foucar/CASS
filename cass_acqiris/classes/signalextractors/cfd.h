/** Finds Signals in a waveform.
 *
 * Analyzes a waveform and find signals using a constant fraction algorithm.
 * It then does all the further analysis of the identified Signal.
 *
 * This class will work on waveforms with a depth of 8 Bits.
 *
 * User settable parameters via CASS.ini:\n
 * One can set these parameters for each SignalProducer of the Detectortype.
 * Therefore the settings will be for the the following signal producers:
 * - For MCP in Delayline and TofDetectors its :
 *   - AcqirisDetectors/%detectorname%/MCP
 * - For Layer Wireends in Delaylinedetectors its:
 *   - AcqirisDetectors/%detectorname%/%Layername%/%Wireendname%

 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{AcqirisInstrument}\n
 *           Acqiris Instrument that this channel is in:
 *           - 8: Camp (Acqiris Multiinstrument with 5 Cards (20 Channels))
 *           - 4: AMO I-ToF
 *           - 5: AMO Magnetic Bottle
 *           - 2: AMO Gas Detector
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{ChannelNumber} \n
 *           Channel within the instrument (starts counting from 0)
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/Timeranges/(0,1,...)/{LowerLimit|UpperLimit}\n
 *           set of timeranges. One can set more than one range of interest.
 *           Default is no timerange, which will result in no signal will be
 *           found.
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{Polarity}\n
 *           the polarity of the signals that we are interested in:
 *           - 1: Positive Polarity
 *           - 2: Negative Polarity
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{Threshold}\n
 *           the theshold for the signals in Volts:
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{Delay}\n
 *           delay in ns used by the constant fraction method:
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{Fraction}\n
 *           fraction used by the constant fraction method:
 * @cassttng .../ConstantFraction/{Walk}\n
 *           walk of the Constant Fraction Discriminator in Volts
