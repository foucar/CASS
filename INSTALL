Install instructions for CASS
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software packages need to be installed and available for building
and running CASS:

QT (version 4.6.x and above)

gSOAP (version 2.7.x and above):
 Download gSOAP from here
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/files/
 to compile and install do the following
   ./configure --prefix=/somewhere
   make
   make install
 where "somewhere" is the place that you want to install the libraries to be
 installed to (ie. /usr/local)


QWT (version 5.2.x and above, but not 6.x or newer):
 To obtain qwt do the following:
   svn co https://qwt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qwt/branches/qwt-5.2
 to compile and install the libs to the following:
   modify qwtconfig.pri and set INSTALLBASE to where the libraries should be
   installed to (ie. /usr/local).
   qmake
   make
   make install



optional Prerequisites
----------------------

The following software packages are needed when enabeling optional components in
CASS:

HDF5 (version 1.8.5 and above):
 Download hdf5 library from here
   http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/
 to compile and install do the following:
   ./configure --prefix=/somewhere --enable-threadsafe --with-pthread=/usr
   make
   make install
 where "somewhere" is the place that you want to install the libraries to be
 installed to (ie. /usr/local)

VIGRA (version 1.7.0 and above) (for single_particle detection):
 Download vigra template library from here:
   http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/vigra-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
 just install the headers by copying them
   cp -r include/. /usr/local/include/.
 where the above /usr/local is just an example on where to install the headers

ROOT (version 5.28.00c and above):
 Download root sources from here
   http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/downloading-root
 to compile and install
   ./configure
   make


Needed Environment Variables
----------------------------

QTDIR: needs to point to the Qt installation directory
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH: points to place where installed headers are (ie. /usr/local/include)
LIBRARY_PATH: points to place where installed libraries are (ie. /usr/local/lib)
LD_LIBRARY_PATH: points to place where installed libraries are (ie. /usr/local/lib)
PATH: points there where you installed the binaries (ie. /usr/local/bin)


When root is enabled you need:
ROOTSYS: pointing to where root is. Additionally you need to add ROOTSYS variable
         to the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables:
  export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 or
  setenv PATH ${ROOTSYS}/bin:${PATH}
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${ROOTSYS}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}


If you are compiling hdf5 enabled, you'll need to also define:
HDF5DIR: pointing at the directory where the HDF5 library is installed.
         The HDF5 library must have been compiled with the "--enable-threadsafe"
         option, otherwise it will break at runtime.
NOTE: the above should not be necessary, if you installed the HDF5 library as
      described.


Building CASS
--------------

To configure CASS for your needs please copy the default config as follows:
  cp cass_defaultconfig.pri cass_myconfig.pri
and make all your changes to the created cass_myconfig.pri. By changing the
INSTALLBASE variable you can control where cass will be installed. Optionally
this parameter can also be set when calling the qmake utility (see below).
The following sequence of commands will build and install CASS:
  qmake [INSTALLBASE=/path/to/your/preferred/binary/directory]
  make
  make install

Compiling CASS on multiple cores with
  make -j
will not work with the current structure.
