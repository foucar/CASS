Install instructions for CASS
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software packages need to be installed and available for building
and running CASS:

QT (version 4.6.x and above)
 Download source with git:
   git clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt.git
 checkout the version you want to build by listing all tags then choosing the
 tag that you want "tagname" into a local branch "bname" with
   git checkout -b bname tagname
 to compile and install
   ./configure -prefix somewhere -opensource
   make
   make install

gSOAP (version 2.7.x and above):
 Download gSOAP from here
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/files/
 to compile and install do the following
   ./configure --prefix=/somewhere
   make
   make install
 where "somewhere" is the place that you want to install the libraries to be
 installed to (ie. /usr/local)


QWT (version 5.2.x and above, but not 6.x or newer):
 To obtain qwt do the following:
   svn co https://qwt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qwt/branches/qwt-5.2
 to compile and install the libs to the following:
   modify qwtconfig.pri and set INSTALLBASE to where the libraries should be
   installed to (ie. /usr/local).
   qmake
   make
   make install



Optional Prerequisites
----------------------

The following software packages are needed when enabeling optional components in
CASS:

HDF5 (version 1.8.5 and above):
 Download hdf5 library from here
   http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/
 to compile and install do the following:
   ./configure --prefix=/somewhere --enable-threadsafe --with-pthread=/usr
   make
   make install
 where "somewhere" is the place that you want to install the libraries to be
 installed to (ie. /usr/local)

VIGRA (version 1.7.0 and above) (for single_particle detection):
 Download vigra template library from here:
   http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/vigra-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
 just install the headers by copying them
   cp -r include/. /usr/local/include/.
 where the above /usr/local is just an example on where to install the headers

ROOT (version 5.28.00c and above):
 Download root sources using git from here
   git clone http://root.cern.ch/git/root.git
 checkout the version you want to build by listing all tags then choosing the
 tag that you want "tagname" into a local branch "bname" with
   git checkout -b bname tagname
 to compile and install (without the need of setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH later on)
   ./configure --prefix=/somewhere --enable-rpath --etcdir=/somewhere
   make [-j]
   make install


Needed Environment Variables
----------------------------

QTDIR: needs to point to the Qt installation directory
PATH: points there where you installed the binaries (ie. /usr/local/bin)


Building CASS
--------------

To configure CASS for your needs please copy the default config as follows:
  cp cass_defaultconfig.pri cass_myconfig.pri
and make all your changes to the created cass_myconfig.pri. By changing the
PREFIX variable you can control where cass will be installed. Optionally
this parameter can also be set when calling the qmake utility (see below).
The following sequence of commands will build and install CASS:
  qmake [PREFIX=/path/to/your/preferred/binary/directory]
  make [-j]
  make install
