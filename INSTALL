Install instructions for CASS
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software packages need to be installed and available for building and running CASS:
  - Qt version 4.5.x or 4.6.x
  - gSOAP 2.7.x


Needed Environment Variables
----------------------------

LCLSSYSINCLUDE: needs to point to the root folder of LCLS Stuff that contains the pdsdata folder
LCLSSYSLIB: needs to point to the folder the build libraries are in.
QTDIR: needs to point to the Qt installation directory

Furthermore, you need fully administratively installed Qt and gSOAP libraries, that is, 
PATH/path, CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH, and LIBRARY_PATH must be set up.

The above means the following, set up the following envionment variables:
GSOAP: pointing to the directory where gsoap is installed
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH: $GSOAP/include
LIBRARY_PATH: $GSOAP/lib



Building CASS
-------------
Compile the LCLS libraries
  cd ${CASS top-level directory}/LCLS
  make x86_64-linux

Go back to the CASS top-level directory and use createMakefiles to, well, create the Makefiles, i. e.,
  cd ${CASS top-level directory}
  ./createMakefiles
then run
  make
  make install
to build and install the software.


Running CASS
------------
in order to run cass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent environment should be properly set; for example:
  <tcsh>  setenv LD_LIBRARY $QTDIR/lib
  <bash>  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib
