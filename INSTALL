Install instructions for CASS
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software packages need to be installed and available for building and running CASS:
  - Qt version 4.5.x or 4.6.x
  - gSOAP 2.7.x


Needed Environment Variables
----------------------------

LCLSSYSINCLUDE: needs to point to the root folder of LCLS Stuff that contains the pdsdata folder
LCLSSYSLIB: needs to point to the folder the build libraries are in.
QTDIR: needs to point to the Qt installation directory

Furthermore, you need fully administratively installed Qt and gSOAP libraries, that is,
PATH/path, CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH, and LIBRARY_PATH must be set up.

The above means the following, set up the following envionment variables:

GSOAP: pointing to the directory where gsoap is installed

CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH: $GSOAP/include:$LCLSSYSINCLUDE
LIBRARY_PATH: $GSOAP/lib:$LCLSSYSLIB



Building CASS
-------------
Do the following
  cd ${CASS top-level directory}
  qmake -r INSTALLBASE=some/path
  make
  make install
to build and install the software.
The qmake command will output warnings when run for the first time. The files it is
complaining about not beeing there will be created by the MAKEFILES qmake will create
from the project files.


Running CASS
------------
in order to run cass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent environment should be properly set; for example:
  <tcsh>  setenv LD_LIBRARY $QTDIR/lib
  <bash>  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib
