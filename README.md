CASS
====

This is the CFEL-ASG Software Suite.

See INSTALL.md for installation instructions.


DOCU
====

The Software Suite is documented using doxygen. One can create a html version
of the documentation by running doxygen on the "doc" subfolder of the CASS
directory. For this please install doxygen on your computer (see INSTALL.md
for details). Then cd into the doc directory and use doxygen there
eg. if you are in the CASS base directory do:

    cd doc
    make doc

This will create a subdirectory of the doc directory called doxygen/html.
Within this directory you will find the html version of the documentation. Just
open index.html with your favorite browser to view the documentation.

An online version of the documentation that shows the latest stable version in
the master branch is located at
